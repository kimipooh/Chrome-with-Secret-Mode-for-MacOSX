# Chrome-with-Secret-Mode-for-MacOSX
This application is for running Google Chrome with Secret mode on MacOSX

This application only carries out 'open -n -a "Google Chrome" --args --incognito' or 'open -n -a "Google Chrome Canary" --args --incognito'.

Therefore, if you don't install Google Chrome or Google Chrome Canary application, the application doesn't work.
